I am a prospective Ph.D. student in Computer Science, actively collaborating with the NLP research community. I volunteer at Cohere for AI as a researcher, assisting with the [AYA](https://cohere.com/research) prompt review, and co-chair the LX NLP Workshop co-located with [NAACL 2024](https://www.latinxinai.org/events/latinx-in-nlp-at-naacl-2024). Currently, I work as an ML Engineer at [Ping4All](https://www.ping4all.lu/), with research interests spanning NLP and computational social science.

Previously, I worked with Professor Jose E. Ochoa at the Research and Innovation Center in Computer Science Labs in Peru, focusing on deep learning methods to detect aggressive or offensive content in social media. I have also volunteered and participated in key events, such as the IISPDL 2019, Khipu 2019, Latinx in AI at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020, the TRAC 2020 Workshop, and the [Mexican NLP Summer School 2021](https://ampln.github.io/escuelaverano2021/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
