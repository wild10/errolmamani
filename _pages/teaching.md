#### [II Peruvian symposium of Deel Learning (SPDL 2020)](https://sites.google.com/view/spdl-2020)

The SPDL brings together undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professionals interested in the field of deep learning and related areas within machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathematics, statistics, and neuroscience.

Presentation: A brief introduction to deep learning for Natural Language processing and the evolution of the deep learning through the last years towards the novel state of the art transformer architectures which are the actual ground breaking neural network architecture that quickly became a new standard for NLP

#### [Todos Vuelven 2023](https://www.todosvuelven.org/home)

this symposium will showcase the experiences of students who have studied abroad. Participants will present their research and insights gained overseas, fostering collaboration and discussion on the impact of international study. It's a great opportunity to connect with peers and share ideas in an inspiring environment.

presentation: I delivered a presentation on my research focused on detecting aggressive language in Spanish using deep learning models. I also discussed my previously published paper, aiming to inspire others by sharing insights on the publication process and encouraging participation in leading AI conferences, such as NeurIPS and NAACL.
