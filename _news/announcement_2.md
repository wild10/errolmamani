First of all, this is not my first time being at volunteer for promoting the Latinx in AI as Co-chair i was previously co-chair in 2022 and I actively participated as volunteer and assistaint in previous workshops as my bio shows. said that, I am thrilled reporting that this time the <a href="https://2024.naacl.org/"> NAACL24</a> took part in Mexico city. for those who don't know this is Latin America country located just next and below USA :smile:. Altought this kind of conference are well know for computacional linguist scientist all around the world, it is still unknow for most of the under-develop countries throught the south of America like my hometown country (PERU). Then supporting this kind of workshop give the newcommer in AI who are working in the intersection of linguistic the opportunity to connect with top scientist or individual to improve and fortunately get the chance to continue developing their skills (below the LatinX mission itself).

> LatinX in AI (LXAI) bridges communities, academics, industry, and politicians working to further AI innovation and resources for LatinX individuals globally. We drive and support research, development, infrastructure, and mentoring programs to boost innovation and capabilities of LatinX professionals working in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

The above means that everyone is welcome to take part in the workshop, but certainly we need to give an access to a selective people in this side. so most of the attendees are from this group. and paragraph later i will explain what we need to get the access to the free budged offered by latinx.
