### Spanish Aggressive Language identification using Deep learning
<div style="text-align: justify">
In my research project, I focused on detecting offensive language in user-generated content on social media platforms. With growing concerns over abusive behavior, technology companies are investing in computational methods to identify aggression and hate speech. Building fron the  foundational of hate-speech,my project explores how Deep Learning techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) can effectively identify offensive language, particularly in Spanish. The study investigates the characteristics of offensive messages, including disparaging language, derogatory adjectives, and profanity.
The results of this research were published in top AI conferences, and I presented my findings through a papers and posters, contributing to the ongoing dialogue in the field and helping to enhance automated detection methods.

### Speaker Identification using Machine Learning Approaches
Today speaker assistants such as Cortana, Google, Siri are used in our mobile phones as a resource that we use in our daily life and that we can inter actuate with them. and one of the main engine oh those kind of technologies are the way to identify the speaker in real-time.  Thus, we are going to focus in the aim of identifying the speaker from a single audio information using machine learning techniques, although this work involves hard and advance task in computer science the scientists were working on this problems for a long time until our life, but we still need a new approaches to identify, tackling problems from audio retrieval from real scenarios

### Sentiment Analysis for Spanish (Peru) using Machine Learning 
we are working in information retrieval and analysis of the social media publicacion such as twitter for the opinion mining. We focus in the doing the sentiment analysis task for the Peruvian case study using the collected post.

#### Indigenous(Quechua) Lyrics text Generation using Deep Learning 
Our first approach is to develop deep learning models to first accomplish the task of generating Spanish and Quechua lyrics automatically for the local music in Peru, this is really not explored task recently we got good outperforming models in text generation and we are interested in exploring this task in other scenarios like music lyrics generation. we are enthusiastically moved that this kind of technology using Artificial Intelligence can help to persevere our culture and contribute to the creating of the new music since in Peru we are daily losing our native language with all this kind of universal incursion in the music side.
