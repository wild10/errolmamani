  abstract={The increasing influence from users in social media has made that aggressive content disseminates over the internet. To tackle this problem, recent advances in Aggressive Language Detection have demonstrated a good performance of Deep Learning techniques. Recently Transformer based architectures such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) outperformed previous aggressive text detection baselines. However, most of the Transformers-based approaches are unable to properly capture global information such as language vocabulary. Thus, in this work, we focus on aggressive content detection using the combination of Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN) to capture global information and BERT to model local information.},

%  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
%  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
%  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
