  abstract={The increasing influence from users in social media has made that aggressive content disseminates over the internet. To tackle this problem, recent advances in Aggressive Language Detection have demonstrated a good performance of Deep Learning techniques. Recently Transformer based architectures such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) outperformed previous aggressive text detection baselines. However, most of the Transformers-based approaches are unable to properly capture global information such as language vocabulary. Thus, in this work, we focus on aggressive content detection using the combination of Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN) to capture global information and BERT to model local information.},
